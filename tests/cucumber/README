To run the test cases, execute the following commands in this directory:
  bundle install
  cucumber

To run a single test case, use the following command:
  cucumber -r features /path/to/testcase.feature
  
To run a single scenario, add the line number at the end. For example:
  cucumber -r features features/gui-manage/account.feature:11

The features/demo folder contains some demo scenarios to show how cucumber works. Use these as reference. They will be deleted in the future.
